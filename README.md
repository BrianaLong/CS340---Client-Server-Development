# CS340---Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Writing rpograms that are user friendly is highly important. Being able to organize the code into smaller modules allows for easy editing and readablility. By creating seperat ewidgets, there is an easier way to maintain and scale the modular code.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
First the problem must be defined. By understanding the requirments of the database and dashboard allows the tasks to be broken down. Next the structure and intergration of the database with the widgets is created. Being able to test constantly allows for iterative development of the tools. This assingment felt more real world than others. The application was complex with multiple parts and modules.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientist use computational methods and algorithms to create systems that solve real world problems. By automating databade operations there is a reduction in manual work that can lead to human errors. Creating the CRUD module allows easy managment to change the modules as needed. The system is also scaleable for larger projects and companies.
